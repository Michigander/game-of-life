# isotope

## A webpage could be a programming environment.

Imagine a text box, where the entered text became the input to a language compiler. The webpage as a whole represents a working program. It would not need a server, only an instantiation of the IDE. The language is the program is the IDE. I might even expand that to include the deployment of the program.

The compilation is the execution.

This language / app / IDE program would be used as follows:

1. open terminal
2. emply isotope cli - e.g. - isotope spawn 'yeeter'
3. yeeter directory has a soil and seed directory. what you put in seed becomes the program.
4. there is also a grow.sh program, which can be editable if run with --god
5. running grow spawns a planting
6. a planting is the program

Isotope is itself an isotope, created from the first program. This very well may still be the first program.

Example of a program:

1. grow --god
2. enter text 'open 8000;'
3.

## other names:

- atlas
- isotope
- eden
